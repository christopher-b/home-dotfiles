#Dotfiles

My dotfiles repo. A simple setup to symlink dotfiles into `~`. Just run `./bootstrap`. The bootstrap script will also source any files in `source-once`.

Most of the files here are from:

* [Zach Holman's Dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles)
* [Mathias Bynens' Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles)
